# ddf--gapminder--systema_globalis
Gapminder's fact-base with local &amp; global statistics.

This is the main dataset used in Gapminder tools. It is combining the output from most of the other Gapminder datasets in Open Numbers.

## Data
This dataset contains geographic boundaries of subdivisions of countries, mainly from [GADM][GADM], which is a spatial database of the location of the world's administrative areas (or adminstrative boundaries) for use in GIS and similar software. See [GADM][GADM] for more info about the underlaying data and the coverage. Currently nothing but the intention is to inclde the majority of content that [GADM][GADM] has.

## How to update
Currently it is maintained by manualy copyig data from multiple other datasets.
The plan is to automate the process by using a file called ddf--imports.csv
