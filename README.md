# Systema Globalis
The name is inspired by [Systema Naturae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systema_Naturae); the first systematic compilation of all living things from year 1735, by the Swedish Scientist Carl von Linn√©. The goal of Systema Globalis is to compile all public statistics; Social, Economic and Environmental; into a comparable total dataset.

## Data
This is the main dataset used in tools on the official Gapminder website. It contains local &amp; global statistics combined from hundreds of sources.

## How to update
Currently the dataset is maintained by manually copyig data from multiple other datasets.
The plan is to automate the process by using a file called ddf--imports.csv
